    <div class="explanation">
        We are building a dynamic react mini application that has a counter that increments each time a button is pressed.
        <p>
            First we are creating a react class Counter and attaching in to a dom element. The class will have state and properties.
        </p>
        <p>
            The use of state should be limited to dynamic content, because it adds overhead since it needs to make sure
            there are no changes in what is being displayed to the user and also needs to prevent conflicts when changing state.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whenever you have things that don't need to be dynamic, use properties instead and construct it declaratively. This is more performant.
        </p>

    const Counter = React.createClass({
        getInitialState: () => {
            return { count: 0 };
        },
        clickHandler: function () {
            this.setState({
                count: this.state.count + 1
            })
        },
        render: function () {
            return (<button onClick={this.clickHandler}>Clicked { this.state.count }{ this.props.suffix }</button>);
        }
    });

    ReactDOM.render(<Counter suffix=" times!"/>, document.getElementById('target'));
